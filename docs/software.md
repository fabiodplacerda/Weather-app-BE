# Travel Info Backend Application

The backend application for the Travel Info frontend is designed to manage user registrations, store favorite cities, and facilitate quick access to weather forecasts through the frontend application. By entering their email and password, users can create an account.

MongoDB is a secure database that holds this data. Once users are registered they can log in and manage their list of favorite cities. The backend stores these cities in MongoDB, associating them with the respective user accounts. Each userâ€™s data, including their email, password, and list of favorite cities, is stored as a document in MongoDB.

This allows for easy retrieval and updating of user information and their preferred cities. In summary, the backend application, integrated with the Travel Info frontend, leverages MongoDB for efficient and flexible data storage. It manages user registrations, login and favorite cities, while the frontend interacts directly with weather forecast services to provide users with real-time weather information for their favorite cities. This architecture ensures a smooth and secure user experience, combining the strengths of both frontend and backend components.
